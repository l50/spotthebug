>We from the company Hugsoft have created special HugDrones® to satisfy our costumers’ needs. While the drones are still in their test->phase (blades cutting off fingers, etc), they already got hacked by a hacker named Lamius. Somehow Lamius retrieved the secret key for >the user interface, and he's programming all drones to shout at people. Please help us!
>You'll find the source code in the secure drop zone. Please perform an amazing code review so our system will never get hacked again!
Sounds like a job for you? Find out how Lamius retrieved the secret key. Also, report any other bugs or design flaws you encounter in the >source code. This is the only source file Hugsoft will disclose.
